# Notes

I spent a lot longer on this in the end, mostly because I decided to focus on the architecture.

The solution is over-engineered for what it is, but I was trying to show how I would approach the architecture if this was a real world application that I was going to continue to develop in the future.

I made the fake db async to show that if you had a real db that had an async api then you would use that.
